        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, we have implemented f ash ADC
with a 3-bit resolution.
Design and simulation of 3-bit f ash ADC are
carried out using the LT-spice model files.
Parameters such as conversion time, the average
power of 3- bit flash ADC are calculated and
compared.
Mainly we focused to reduce the power
consumption of 3-bit flash ADC by optimizing the
encoder circuitry.
We have implemented Memristor based encoder,
3-bit Flash ADC implemented utilizing encoder
with memristor consumes less power and offers
less delay.
Further, it is intended to increase the resolution of
f ash ADC and also to reduce the average power
consumed by the circuit by optimizing the flash
ADC circuitry.
